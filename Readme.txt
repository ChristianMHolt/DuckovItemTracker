Name suggestions:
	Name suggestions are generated based on the file names for the images
	found in ItemPNGS.
	In order to get accurate name suggestions all image names should be
	written in capital case. Organic Fiber would be OrganicFiber.png.
	
	Spaces are automatically placed between letters and numbers unless their 
	is a hyphen seperating them.
	
	Spaces will not get placed between Capital letters and an underscore should
	be used to indicate the space.
	This is useful for items like the DT MRD-556, whose corresponding image
	filename would be DT_MDR-556.png.
	
	Placing an underscore at the end of a images filename prevents any spaces 
	other than those specified with an underscore from being added.
	This is useful for items like the MP7, whose corresponding image filename 
	would be MP7_.png.
	
	Selecting a name suggestion automatically loads the corresponding image.
